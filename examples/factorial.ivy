-- One way to express a factorial function.
let factorial = fn (0) => 1;
let factorial = fn (x) => x * fact(x);

-- Another way!
let factorial = fn (x) => match (x) (
    | 0 -> 1
    | x -> x * factorial(x)
);

match (woah) (
    | 1 -> "January"
    | 2 -> "February"
    | 3 -> "March"
    | 4 -> "April"
    | 5 -> "May"
);

-- Call the function
factorial(12);
